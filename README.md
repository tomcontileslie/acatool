acatool
=======

_A tool for quickly identifying the French academie that a place belongs to._

This tool is purely there to avoid doing two google searches, one for the
departement that the town is in, then one for the academie that that
departement is in. Uses geo.api.gouv.fr along with some conversion tables
for departements taken from Wikipedia.

)(note that Caen and Rouen have since been merged into Normandie.)_
